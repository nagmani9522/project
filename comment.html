Children are always considered next to the pious versions of the Almighty who always strive to inculcate happiness, joy, innocence and hope.<br>

 The future of a nation is determined by the way it treats its children and its women, after all, children imply a hope, 
 a hope to strengthen not only the economy of the country, but also to provide the country with skilled human resources
 who have access to the basic amenities essential for the existence coupled with the tenets of the education in India.
 
It is the moral duty of every citizen for the country to ensure that the childhood of our children is protected and not marred with instances
 like that of child labour in India which arise out of poverty and helplessness.

UNICEF has categorized child work into three categories:

1. Within the family- Children are engaged in domestic household tasks without pay.

3. Outside the family- Example- commercial shops in restaurants and jobs, prostitution etc. <br>

1) Industrial Child Labor

Industrial sector in India is the largest employer of children below the legal age of 18.
Approximately, over 10 Million children between the age group of 5 to 14 years are working in informal or small industries, including around 4.5 Million girls. 
Small enterprises like garment industry, brick kiln, agriculture, fireworks industries, diamond industries etc,
 constitute some of the largest employer of children. Sometimes such industries operate from homes, 
 making it difficult for the authorities to take appropriate actions.

Unorganized sector in India is one of the largest employers of children and the most visible too. 
Children could be easily spotted, working in road side dhabas and eateries, tea shops or grocery stores. 
The owners of such small businesses prefer children as they are easy to handle and easy to fire.

2) Domestic Child Labor

Domestic child labors constitute 10% of the total child labors in India. 
They include both boys and girls domestically employed by wealthy families to look after their everyday chorus.
 Such children have no option but to serve the needs of other families in an age when they should be attending school and playing with friends. 
 Poverty is the main factor behind children being employed as domestic help.
 Usually the parents give their consent in hope of money and a stable shelter for their children.

The statics reveal a grim picture – nearly 20% of all the domestic workers employed are below the age of 14 years and the figures include mainly girls.
 These children are employed as live in servants, doing daily chorus of the family like – 
 washing, cooking, looking after pets or younger children and other works.

3) Bonded Child Labors

Bonded child labour means as a child who is employed forcibly to pay off a debt of his parents or a guardian. 
Though the numbers of bonded child labors have considerably declined in recent past due strict government supervision and laws banning it.
 it is silently followed in isolated and remote places.</pre>
